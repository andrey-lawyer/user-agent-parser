# User-Agent Parser

**User-Agent Parser** is a web application designed to analyze and display information about the User-Agent string from a browser or a manually entered string. It uses React and Ant Design to create a user-friendly interface to display details about the browser, operating system, device, and other parameters.

## Description

This tool helps analyze User-Agent strings, providing detailed information about the current browser, its version, operating system, and other parameters. You can either retrieve information about your current browser's User-Agent or input a custom User-Agent string for analysis.

## Tech Stack

- **React** — for building the user interface.
- **Ant Design** — for the component library.
- **Axios (or Fetch)** — for making API requests.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** — for the app's logic.
